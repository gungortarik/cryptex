# Cryptex

Cryptex is a cross-platform, local-first personal memory and knowledge system for macOS and Windows.

Current implementation milestone: **M0 — Foundation**.

Authoritative project documentation lives under `docs/`. Runtime data must remain outside this source repository.

## Current implementation handoff

Before starting implementation or review work, read [`docs/34_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md`](docs/34_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md). It records the current milestone, verified evidence, open blockers, and the exact next task. Authoritative specifications and accepted ADRs still take precedence.

## Standalone M0 Desktop build

Use `pnpm --filter @cryptex/desktop tauri:package-smoke` for a standalone probe
or `pnpm --filter @cryptex/desktop tauri:package --bundles app` for the macOS
application bundle. These commands build frontend assets and stage the sidecar.

Rust `--release` alone does not select Tauri's embedded frontend. A release
compiled without `tauri/custom-protocol` now exits with
`RELEASE_FRONTEND_MODE_REJECTED` before Tauri/daemon startup. Direct release
Desktop tests/builds must explicitly enable `--features tauri/custom-protocol`;
they do not replace frontend build or native package preparation. Debug
development through the existing Vite/Tauri commands remains supported.
